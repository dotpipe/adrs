This is what we bring:

-If we bring in 4 people per ad per hour, then we've made them
  a lot of money beyond their store revenues without.

-The 5th star in the average is for perfect reviews.
  If it is broken, it'll go to a rounded up review of stars,
    even if that means 4 stars.

-Analytics, that on review, if person is physically near to
  the business, review will go to database and we will count
    it as one of our users used the app during the store visit.

This is what we do:

-For each 10 stores you bring, being an affiliate
  you get $50 once they do $10 in advertising.
  
-Each ad is marked for a certain time to begin
  and to end. The $1 will be taken each hour,
    from the beginning.

-If $1 cannot be taken from the account of the
  store, then the ad will not be listed.

-If there is no advertisement for that time period,
  remove marker.

-No refunds. Once ad is in paid for and placed,
  ad(s) are there for the hour.

-No money is in escrow.

-Recreate XML file every 15 minutes. All markers still on the map
  will be advertising that hour.

-Every 15 minutes new ads will be listed,
  reload user maps.

-On click of a marker load ads to bottom square.

-Timing is everything.

-Ads can be templated. 1 picture per ad. Or so many together
  fitting in the 400x400px box. Stores will just upload them.

-A gallery of their pictures will be kept up by the stores.
  These are unseen by the users, except what's being advertised.
    Stores, may delete, resize, crop, and do whatever else to them.

-Report Flags will be available on ads.

-Only legal businesses may be advertised on the program.
  They will need to identify themselves.

-Each ad will have the store name with them, and a slogan.
  If the prefer they can go without the slogan and name.
    If they opt out, they will need a picture ad. Picture ads
      that do not opt out, will have they name/slogan on top
        of their ads.
